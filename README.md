# Panic Attack Prevention Bot

## Objective
The Panic Attack Prevention Bot is an AI-powered solution designed to detect and manage panic attacks in real-time. It integrates multiple AI technologies, such as facial expression recognition, sentiment analysis, and multimodal data inputs, to provide timely interventions and support.

## Features
- **Facial Expression Recognition**: Detects emotions like stress and anxiety with 85% accuracy.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes text or speech inputs with 88% accuracy using BERT.
- **Multimodal Integration**: Combines facial recognition and sentiment analysis with heart rate data.

## Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- FER Library
- NLTK, Hugging Face Transformers
- HealthKit API (planned)

## Achievements
- Improved detection accuracy through fine-tuning.
- Developed a modular architecture for future feature expansion.
